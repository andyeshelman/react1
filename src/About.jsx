      <h3>I'm the Avatar and you gotta deal with it!</h3>
      <p>Korra is the current incarnation of the Avatar and immediate successor of Avatar Aang.
        Born and raised in the Southern Water Tribe, where she mastered waterbending, earthbending, and firebending,
        she later relocated to Republic City to attain a similar proficiency with airbending under the tutelage and guidance of Tenzin,
        as well as to help her overcome her aversion to the spiritual aspects of the bending arts. With the assistance of Aang's spirit,
        Korra gained the ability to energybend and, after connecting with her past lives, she gained the capacity to enter the Avatar State at will,
        marking her transition into a fully realized Avatar. However, due to her temporary separation from Raava during the Harmonic Convergence of 171 AG,
        she no longer has a connection to her past lives. Following her battle with Zaheer and the Red Lotus, she spent three years recovering from trauma.
        Later, after defeating Kuvira and bringing an end to the Earth Empire, Korra started a romantic relationship with her best friend, Asami Sato.</p>
